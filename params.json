This leads to hugely complex libraries which are required to be loaded every request to handle every possible situation.  What if you could write controllers that were actually part of the framework and could redirect the flow to new sections of the framework at runtime?\r\n\r\nlifecycle\r\n====\r\nAs it stands now, there are 6 portions to the request lifecycle:\r\n * analyze();\r\n * resources();\r\n * authenticate();\r\n * process();\r\n * output();\r\n * hangup();\r\n\r\nEach part of the lifecycle functions as a signal/slot event mechanism.  You add your libraries to the lifecycle by telling the associate you can handle a part of a lifecycle.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n  associate_iCanHandle('hangup', 'mytools/recordexecutiontime.php');\r\n```\r\n\r\nInside the specified file should be a class named Mytools_Recordexecutiontime and a function called hangup();\r\n\r\nIf, during the process of certain requests, you decide that you want to completely alter the execution path you can *own* part of a lifecycle with associate_iCanOwn( $cycle, $file).  This will erase all previously identified slots for that part of the lifecycle.\r\n\r\nsounds dumb\r\n==========\r\nIndeed, and perhaps it is dumb.  Maybe you are wondering where all the nifty libraries are that force you to do things a certain way.  Those already exist and are just waiting for you to hook them in!  You can chain in an entire Zend Framework application with one class that wraps up $application->bootstrap()->run().  What's the point of that, you say?  It gives you a starting point to dissect your existing application and inject resource-light responses when needed.\r\n\r\nsetup\r\n=====\r\nCopy etc/bootstrap.php.txt to etc/bootstrap.php\r\nAdd the following line to etc/bootstrap.php\r\n\r\n```php\r\n  associate_iCanHandle('output', 'mypage/helloworld.php');\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a folder in local called 'mypage'.\r\nCreate a file called 'helloworld.php' in 'mypage'.\r\n\r\nAdd this to the helloworld.php file\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nclass Mypage_Helloworld {\r\n\r\n\tpublic function output(&$request) {\r\n\t\techo \"Hello World.\";\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nadvanced\r\n=======\r\nWhat happens if you put this in the output function of hello world?\r\n```php\r\n\tassociate_iCanHandle('output', 'mypage/footer.php');\r\n```\r\n\r\nthings\r\n======\r\nSometimes you need to use an object in more than one place (duh).  These are 'things' in nofw.  If you want to have a standard user class, in the etc/bootstrap.php file simply add:\r\n```php\r\nassociate_IAmA('user', 'myuser/user_model.php');\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other parts of your code, you can retreive this user with:\r\n```php\r\n$user = associate_getMeA('user');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same technique can be used for DB handles or wrapper objects.  Experiment loading up 'things' in the 'resources' lifecycle.\r\n\r\nYou can pass constructor arguments to things as well:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nassociate_IAmA('db', 'mylibs/mysql.php');\r\n$db1 = associate_getMeA('db', 'mysql://root@localhost/mydb');\r\n$db2 = associate_getMeA('db', 'mysql://root@localhost/otherdb');\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also request a clone of an object with:\r\n```php\r\nassociate_IAmA('user', 'myuser/user.php');\r\n$loggedInUser = associate_getMeA('user');\r\n$otherUser    = associate_getMeANew('user');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe $otherUser will be a clone (in PHP5) of the same object used for $loggedInUser.  Objects with different constructor arguments are always different, they are cached with the name of the file and an SHA1 sum of the constructor arguments.\r\n\r\nundefined things\r\n======\r\nYou can request a thing that has not been defined.  If you do this you will receive a new Nofw_Proto object reference.  This can be usefull for rapidly prototyping interconnections between libraries.  Starting with a bare object, you can inject a real class definition *later*.  Any function call against a Nofw_Proto will return itself and log the call against an undefined thing with any \"logger\" that you define.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$cart = _getMeA(\"shopping_cart\");\r\n$cart->addItem(\"abc\", 123)->\r\n       retotal()->\r\n       updateInventory()->\r\n       save();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, after a few iterations of development or complete launches, you can add a full class definition if you need to expand the capabilities of the thing.\r\n```php\r\nassociate_IamA('shopping_cart', 'myecommerce/cart.php');\r\n```\r\n\r\nflags / settings\r\n======\r\nSetting and getting global values can be done with the associate_get()/associate_set() functions.  This can be handy when you set database connection information in the bootstrap, then load that information in your database abstraction library.  Other ideas can be copyright inforation, version strings, and template variables.\r\n\r\ncustom lifecycles\r\n======\r\nThere's nothing stopping your from creating your own chain of command with the same lifecycles used in the master process running.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n\t\tassociate_iCanHandle('Top Menu', 'mytemplate/menu.php');\r\n\t\tassociate_iCanHandle('Bottom Footer', 'mytemplate/menu.php');\r\n\t\tif (isset($_SESSION['sparkMessages'])) {\r\n\t\t\tassociate_iCanHandle('Spark Messages', 'mytemplate/sparkmsg.php');\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t//later...\r\n\r\n\t\t$associate = Nofw_Associate::getAssociate();\r\n\t\t$request = $associate->getMeA('request');\r\n\t\t$output = '';\r\n\t\twhile ($svc =  $associate->whoCanHandle('Top Menu')) {\r\n\t\t\t$output .= $svc->template($request, 'Top Menu');\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\twhile ($svc =  $associate->whoCanHandle('Spark Messages')) {\r\n\t\t\t$output .= $svc->template($request, 'Spark Messages');\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\twhile ($svc =  $associate->whoCanHandle('Main Content')) {\r\n\t\t\t$output .= $svc->template($request, 'Main Content');\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\twhile ($svc =  $associate->whoCanHandle('Bottom Footer')) {\r\n\t\t\t$output .= $svc->template($request, 'Bottom Footer');\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\treturn $output.\"\\n\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nI build large sites, this isn't for me\r\n=====\r\nSure, so you should know how important it is to control resources on every page hit.  Do you know how your existing framework can handle large modifications to the workflow?  What if you had to add on API functionality, where the requests don't have cookies (and therefore sessions)?  When you're outputting JSON data do you need to load the entire templating library just to turn it off so you can send raw JSON?  What about a public RSS feed that is cached, can you avoid loading user and database libraries at all on those types of requests?  Does your framework offer customization at every level?\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
